## Behavioral Questions
- **Cause**
	- Why did you need to take action?
- **Action**
	- Steps you took so solve problem.
	- Be positive
	- Don't be humble
- **Result**
	- How are you better?
- Every behavioral in Banki has a three sentence response, one for each above.
- Start with: At my last opportunity...

- [x] Give me an example of a project or initiative that you started on your own. What prompted you to get started?
	- Cause: At a previous company we had project managers assigned to several different teams where workload would fluctuate quite a bit.
	- Action: I noticed an opportunity to flatten the workload of the PM's, by creating a shared PM pool. 
	- Result: This was possible by running a high level kanban of all projects assigned by PM to get visibility to workload. It also allowed knowledge sharing such that it was much easier for a PM to step in on any given team.
- [x] Tell me about a time you had to work on several projects at once. How did you handle this?
	- Cause: I was working on two large projects for two separate clients that were at different stages of their lifecycle. One project was in production and the other project was in the implementation phase.
	- Action: I decided to send a less experienced colleague to the installation site while I went to do a production check-in on the other project in China. Prior to leaving I briefed my colleague in on the project and told then what to look out for.
	- Result: While in China I had daily calls with my colleague as well as received daily photo reports to review the installation. Both projects end up being financially successful. The tight communication and teamwork is ultimately what allowed it to be so.

### CS Theory 
- [x] What is recursion and give an example using javascript?

	- Use: Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach.
	- Example: A classic example is computing a factorial given a number "num":
	- ```function factorial(num){
	    if(num === 1){
	        return num;
	    }
		return num * factorial(num-1)
	}```
